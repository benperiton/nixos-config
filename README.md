## Structure
- `flake.nix`: Entrypoint for hosts and home configurations. Also exposes a
  devshell for boostrapping (`nix develop` or `nix-shell`).
- `lib`: A few lib functions for making my flake cleaner
- `hosts`: NixOS Configurations, accessible via `nixos-rebuild --flake`.
  - `common`: Shared configurations consumed by the machine-specific ones.
    - `global`: Configurations that are globally applied to all my machines.
    - `optional`: Opt-in configurations my machines can use.
  - `rincewind`: Desktop PC - 32GB RAM, R5 3600x, RX 5700XT | Hyprland
  - `vimes`: Lenovo Yoga - 8GB RAM, R7 5700u | Hyprland
  - `twoflower`: Virtual machine - 16GB RAM, i5 6600, GTX 970 | Hyprland
  - `dorfl`: Oracle Could VPS (Ampere) - 24GB RAM & 4vCPUs | Server
- `home`: My Home-manager configuration, acessible via `home-manager --flake`
    - Each directory here is a "feature" each hm configuration can toggle, thus
      customizing my setup for each machine (be it a server, desktop, laptop,
      anything really).
- `modules`: A few actual modules (with options) I haven't upstreamed yet.
- `overlay`: Patches and version overrides for some packages. Accessible via
  `nix build`.
- `pkgs`: My custom packages. Also accessible via `nix build`. You can compose
  these into your own configuration by using my flake's overlay, or consume them through NUR.
- `templates`: A couple project templates for different languages. Accessible
  via `nix init`.


## How to bootstrap
All you need is nix (any version). Run:
```
nix-shell
```

If you already have nix 2.4+, git, and have already enabled `flakes` and
`nix-command`, you can also use the non-legacy command:
```
nix develop
```

`nixos-rebuild --flake .` To build system configurations

`home-manager --flake .` To build user configurations

`nix build` (or shell or run) To build and use packages

`sops` To manage secrets
